# CODE Programming Language
CODE is a simple yet very capable programming language designed to introduce young students to the basic concepts and fundamentals of programming. CODE is a statically-typed and purely interpreted language with its syntax and grammar loosely resembling early BASIC,

## Installation
CODE is currently in its alpha phase of its development stage during which time, pre-built packages of the final product may not yet be available.

1. Clone the repository using Git Bash, GitHub Desktop, or through the VCS in your preferred C# IDE.
2. Build the project within your IDE.
3. Locate the executable output file of the project after the build has finised. It's usually located in `{PROJECT_DIR}/bin/Debug/net7.0/cde.exe` or `bin/Release/net7.0/cde.exe`
4. Open up command prompt within the directory where the executable is located and start interpreting CODE source codes using `cde [file_name]` or `cde.exe [file_name]`
   - Alternatively, you can open the executable directly where you could interact with the interpreter in real-time (REPL Mode).
  
Optionally, to immediately use it on the command prompt as a direct command, you can add the directory of the executable to the PATH variables in your system.
